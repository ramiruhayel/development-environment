# Set up your development environment - aye

This project lets you use a Docker container as a full featured development environment. It allows you to open your day to day bootcamp repository inside a preconfigured container. If you'd like to know more about containers, check out this [link](https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container).

## Before you begin

Ensure you have worked through the [pre-work](https://coding-bootcamp-fsf-prework.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/modules/chapter2/#module-2-install-your-tools) for the bootcamp.

### Windows

1. Install [Git Bash](https://gitforwindows.org/)
2. Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
3. Open a new PowerShell window as an Administrator.
4. To set up your SSH agent run the following:

   ```powershell
   Set-Service ssh-agent -StartupType Automatic # ↵ Enter
   Start-Service ssh-agent # ↵ Enter
   Get-Service ssh-agent # ↵ Enter
   ```

5. Add your existing GitHub SSH key to the agent:

   ```powershell
   ssh-add $HOME\.ssh\id_rsa # ↵ Enter
   ```

### Mac OS

1. Set Bash as the default shell for the Terminal app
   - In the Terminal app on your Mac, choose Terminal > Preferences, then click General.
   - Under “Shells open with,” select “Command (complete path),” then enter `/bin/bash`
2. Add VS Code to your `PATH`:

   - To open a new terminal, press `⌘ Command`+`Space` to open Spotlight search, type `terminal` and hit `↵ Enter`.
   - In the terminal window, copy and paste the following command and press `↵ Enter`:

      ```sh
      cat << EOF >> ~/.bash_profile
      # Add Visual Studio Code (code)
      export PATH="\$PATH:/Applications/Visual Studio Code.app/Contents/Resources/app/bin"
      EOF
      ```

   - To pick up your changes, either start a new terminal, or run the following command in your current terminal:

      ```sh
      source ~/.bash_profile # ↵ Enter
      ```

3. Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

## Development Environment

1. Open a new Git Bash shell (Windows) / Terminal (Mac OS,Linux)

2. Create directory called `code` in your home directory and change into it

   ```shell
   mkdir ~/code # ↵ Enter
   cd ~/code # ↵ Enter
   ```

3. Clone the [development environment](https://github.com/ramiruhayel/development-environment) repository

   ```shell
   git clone git@github.com:ramiruhayel/development-environment.git # ↵ Enter
   ```

   *Some Mac OSX users may get the following error:*

   ```shell
   xcrun: error: invalid active developer path (/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools), missing xcrun at: /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/usr/bin/xcrun. 
   ```

   To resolve it, go back to your terminal and run the folowing command:

   ```console
   $ xcode-select --install # ↵ Enter - You should then see the following output
   xcode-select: note: install requested for command line developer tools
   ```

   A window will open and you will be prompted to update Xcode Command Line tools. This step may take a while. When it completes,

   When the Xcode Command Line tools have finished installing, go back to your terminal and run:

   ```sh
   $ xcodebuild -license # ↵ Enter -- The below message will appear:
   You have not agreed to the Xcode license agreements. You must agree to both license agreements below in order to use Xcode.
   Hit the Enter key to view the license agreements at '/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Resources/English.lproj/License.rtf'
   ```

   Press `↵ Enter` to open the license agreement and hit the `Space` key until the below message appears:

   ```sh
   By typing 'agree' you are agreeing to the terms of the software license agreements. Type 'print' to print them or anything else to cancel, [agree, print, cancel]
   ```

   Type `agree` and hit `↵ Enter` to accept the license agreement.

   Once the installation of the XCode Command Line tools is completed, open a new terminal window and re-run:

   ```shell
   git clone git@github.com:ramiruhayel/development-environment.git # ↵ Enter
   ```

4. Run the following command to open the `~/code/development-environment` folder in VS Code

   ```shell
   code ~/code/development-environment # ↵ Enter
   ```

   Once VS code opens, a notification will appear in the bottom right hand corner about recommended extensions. Click 'Install All'.

   ![Installing Extensions](./images/extension-notification.png)

5. Update the values in `.user.env` with your details. *Be sure not to leave _any white space_ before or after the = signs.*

   To get the path to your **code directory**, return to the Git Bash/Terminal shell you have open and run the following command to print the path:

   ```shell
   pwd # ↵ Enter
   ```

   To get the path to your **bash executable**, in your Git Bash/Terminal shell run the following:

   ```shell
   # OSX and Linux users: 
   whereis bash  # ↵ Enter
   # Windows users: 
   where bash # ↵ Enter
   ```

   ```dotenv
   # User's Email & Name
   USER_NAME='John Doe'
   USER_EMAIL='john.doe@youremailprovider.com'

   # GIT Account Name
   GITHUB_ACCOUNT_NAME='john_doe_github_account'
   GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN='123456789' # <--- Use the `bootcamp-personal-access-token` you created earlier

   # Path to 'code' directory. 
   # The path will look different depending on your OS:
   # Windows: /c/Users/johndoe/code
   # MacOS: /home/johndoe/code
   # Linux: /home/johndoe/code
   #
   CODE_PATH=/home/johndoe/code # <--- Make sure there is no trailing / e.g. ../code NOT ../code/ 

   # Path to your bash executable - you only need to set the one for your operating system
   # 
   # On Windows:
   # ----------- 
   # Be sure to escape the '\' characters in the  path.
   # You do this by adding a second \ in front of the \ characters
   # For example: 
   #    'C:\Users\John Doe\AppData\Local\Programs\Git\bin\bash.exe'
   # becomes
   #    'C:\\Users\\John Doe\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\Git\\bin\\bash.exe'
   #
   WIN_BASH_PATH='C:\\Users\\John Doe\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\Git\bin\\bash.exe'
   #
   # On OSX: 
   # ----------
   # Default location: '/bin/bash'
   #
   OSX_BASH_PATH='/bin/bash'
   #
   # On Linux: 
   # ----------
   # Default location: '/bin/bash'
   #
   LINUX_BASH_PATH='/bin/bash'
   
   # DO NOT CHANGE THIS VALUE!!
   STUDENT_REPO_NAME=bootcamp-resources
   ```

6. Open a new terminal `` Ctrl + Shift + ` ``

7. In the terminal, run the following commands. When prompted, enter your GitHub account password and hit ↵ Enter.

   ```shell
   chmod u+x ./configure-development-environment.sh # ↵ Enter
   ./configure-development-environment.sh # ↵ Enter
   ```

## Open your workspace in the development container

1. Press `F1` to open the Command Palette.

2. Type `Remote-Containers: Reopen In Container` and press enter.

3. Your VS Code session will restart, and reopen in the development container (be patient - this may take a little while).

## Add your first activity to your `bootcamp-resources` repository

1. Open a new terminal `` Ctrl + Shift + ` ``

2. Unzip the first Activity for Week 1, Day 1 into the `bootcamp-resources` directory

   ```shell
   unzip ../01-HTML-Git-CSS.zip # ↵ Enter
   ```

3. List the contents of the `bootcamp-resources` directory

   ```shell
   ls -R # ↵ Enter
   ```

   The output should be as follows:

   ```shell
   .:
   .  ..  01-HTML-Git-CSS

   ./01-HTML-Git-CSS:
   .  ..  Day-1

   ./01-HTML-Git-CSS/Day-1:
   .  ..  01-ConsoleCommands

   ./01-HTML-Git-CSS/Day-1/01-ConsoleCommands:
   .  ..  bash-terminal-commands-cheatsheet.md  README.md
   ```

   **_Your TA will send out each week's activities as you progress through the bootcamp._**

4. Add the new files to your local repository. This will stage them for the first commit

   ```shell
   git add . # ↵ Enter
   # Adds the files in the local repository and stages them for commit.
   # To unstage a file, use 'git reset HEAD YOUR-FILE'.
   ```

5. Commit the files that you've staged in your local repository:

   ```shell
   git commit -m "Added first Activity for Week 1" # ↵ Enter
   # Commits the tracked changes and prepares them to be pushed to a remote repository.
   # To remove this commit and modify the file, use 'git reset --soft HEAD~1' and commit and add the file again.
   ```

6. Configure your local repository:

   ```shell
   git branch -M main # ↵ Enter
   git remote add origin git@github.com:robynheslop/bootcamp-resources.git # ↵ Enter
   # Set the default branch to main
   # Set the upstream to your bootcamp-resources repository
   ```

7. Push the changes in your local repository to GitHub

   ```shell
   git push -u origin main # ↵ Enter
   # Pushes the changes in your local repository up to the remote repository you specified as the origin

   ```
